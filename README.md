# fetus-l4

currently the repo has a general framework to accept multiple grammars

this is so that we can iterate multiple grammars and test them rapidly while designing fetus-l4

```
npm run i
npm run compile -- grammars/test
```

# TODO

- generalize parse to take in list of strings, to be included into grammar `js` file
- output to be saved to a file

# TODO future

- react app to take in fetus-l4 strings
- ?? ast viewer
- render ast as... (output)
